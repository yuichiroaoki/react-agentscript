An agentscript react component

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-agentscript ts-agent
```

## Usage

```typescript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Agentscript from "./Agentscript";
import Model from "../models/AntsModel";

export const AgentscriptComponent = () => {
  const [anim, setAnim] = useState<any | undefined>();
  const [reset, setReset] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [model, setModel] = useState<any | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    updateModel();
  }, []);

  const updateModel = () => {
    const newModel = new Model();
    setModel(newModel);
  };
  return (
    <Agentscript
      view={{
        width: 800,
        drawOptions: {
          turtlesColor: (t) => (t.carryingFood ? "red" : "blue"),
          patchesColor: (p) => {
            if (p.isNest) return "blue";
            if (p.isFood) return "red";
            return "black";
          },
          turtlesSize: 5,
          turtlesShape: "bug",
        },
      }}
      animation={{
        step: step,
        fps: fps,
      }}
      reset={reset}
      model={model}
      setAnim={setAnim}
    />
  );
};
```

## Development

### Testing

```
npm run test
```

### Building

```
npm run build
```

### Storybook

To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
npm run storybook
```

To export your Storybook as static files:

```
npm run storybook:export
```

You can then serve the files under `storybook-static` using S3, GitHub pages, Express etc. I've hosted this library at: https://www.harveydelaney.com/react-component-library

### Generating New Components

I've included a handy NodeJS util file under `util` called `create-component.js`. Instead of copy pasting components to create a new component, you can instead run this command to generate all the files you need to start building out a new component. To use it:

```
npm run generate YourComponentName
```

This will generate:

```
/src
  /YourComponentName
    YourComponentName.tsx
    YourComponentName.stories.tsx
    YourComponentName.test.tsx
    YourComponentName.types.ts
    YourComponentName.scss
```

The default templates for each file can be modified under `util/templates`.

Don't forget to add the component to your `index.ts` exports if you want the library to export the component!

### Installing Component Library Locally

Let's say you have another project (`test-app`) on your machine that you want to try installing the component library into without having to first publish the component library. In the `test-app` directory, you can run:

```
npm i --save ../react-component-library
```

which will install the local component library as a dependency in `test-app`. It'll then appear as a dependency in `package.json` like:

```JSON
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "react-component-library": "file:../react-component-library",
    ...
  },
  ...
```

Your components can then be imported and used in that project.

### Using Component Library SASS Variables

I've found that it's helpful to export SASS variables to projects consuming the library. As such, I've added the `rollup-plugin-copy` NPM package and used it to copy the [`src/typography.scss`](src/typography.scss) and [`variables.scss`](src/variables.scss) into the `build` directory as part of the Rollup bundle process. This allows you to use these variables in your projects consuming the component library.

For example, let's say you installed `harvey-component-library` into your project. To use the exported variables/mixins, in a SASS file you would do the following:

```Sass
@import '~harvey-component-library/build/typography';

.example-container {
    @include heading;

    color: $harvey-white;
}
```

## Additional Help

### Dark Mode

The example component `TestComponent` respects the user's dark mode operating system preferences and renders the component in the appropriate theme.

This is achieved by using the media query: `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` in combination with CSS variables. The colours that change depending on dark mode preference can be found in [`src/variables.scss`](src/variables.scss). Example usage of these variables can be found within [`src/TestComponent/TestComponent.scss`](src/TestComponent/TestComponent.scss).

Read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme for more details.

### Using Alternatives to Sass

#### Less or Stylus

The Rollup plugin `rollup-plugin-postcss` supports Sass, Less and Stylus:

- For Stylus, install stylus: `yarn add stylus --dev`
- For Less, install less: `yarn add less --dev`

You can then remove `node-sass` from your dependencies.

#### CSS Modules

If you want to use CSS Modules, update `postcss` in `rollup-config.js` to:

```
postcss({
  modules: true
})
```

#### Styled Components

If you want to use [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/), the changes required are a bit more involved. As such, I've created a branch where I've got `styled-components` working in this component library, [check it out here](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/tree/styled-components).

### Component Code Splitting

Code splitting of your components is not supported by default.

[Read this section of my blog post](https://blog.harveydelaney.com/creating-your-own-react-component-library/#introducing-code-splitting-optional-) to find out how and why you would enable code splitting of your components. In summary, code splitting enables users to import components in isolation like:

```
import TestComponent from 'harvey-component-library/build/TestComponent';
```

This can reduce the bundle size for projects using older (CJS) module formats.

You can check out [this branch](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/tree/code-splitting) or [this commit](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/commit/94631be5a871f3b39dbc3e9bd3e75a8ae5b3b759) to see what changes are neccesary to implement it.

Please note, there's an issue with code splitting and using `rollup-plugin-postcss`. I recommend using `rollup-plugin-sass` instead alongside code splitting.

### Supporting Image Imports

Add the following library to your component library [@rollup/plugin-image](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/image):

```
npm i -D @rollup/plugin-image
```

Then add it to `rollup-config.js`:

```
...
plugins:[
  ...,
  image(),
  ...
]
...
```

You can then import and render images in your components like:

```tsx
import logo from "./rollup.png";

export const ImageComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <img src={logo} />
  </div>
);
```

### Supporting JSON Imports

Add the following library to your component library [@rollup/plugin-json](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/json):

```
npm i -D @rollup/plugin-json
```

Then add it to `rollup-config.js`:

```
...
plugins:[
  ...,
  json(),
  ...
]
...
```

You can then import and use JSON as ES6 Modules:

```tsx
import data from "./some-data.json";

export const JsonDataComponent = () => <div>{data.description}</div>;
```
